# document-invoice

### üìùDescription
---
In this repostory, we are going to implement a very interesting project that is called `Document Invoice`. The main appliction of this API is reading a document and insert its information into a database. This process can be done automatically without human interference.Just take a photo from the form in a appropriate position, pass it into a program and thats it; all of the informations have been passed into the database. 

This application contains three main sections: The first one image scanning. To do this, we have to create an API to get an input form, then applies some image preprocessing and then output the scanned image with **high resolution quality**. We want high resolution input because the output accuracy of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) application which is `pytesseract` is highly dependent on the input image quality.  

The second section is to define the OCR funcion to grab the preprocessed form and extract each and every information from prespecified locations. And the last step is to create a sql database and connect it to the Python file.

We will be going through into each these subcategories more deeply in the next section.

#### Image Scanning
This is the most important step in this project. Because it contains image preprocessing step and without appropriate preprocessing we are not able to get appropriate results. Our image preprocessing steps contains of: `contour detection`, `morphological operations` and `image sharpening`. Thanks to this [repository](https://github.com/andrewdcampbell/OpenCV-Document-Scanner) most of the programming steps is done.

To start by, first the input image is passed into program, then [lsd](https://github.com/primetang/pylsd) module detects the boundary lines in the image. Then boundaries will be divided into horizontal


#### OCR'ing The Scanned Image
The next important step is to read the document fields. To do so,we use `Pytesseract` program to reach our purpose. You can download the Pytesseract installer via this [link](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). In order to complete this task, we defined two functions; `clearup_text` to omit words that OCR can not read them and `documentOCR`. In this function we utilized `namedtuples` for grouping objects without defining a class. This is one of the important feartures that Python has.

> namedtuples are immutable containers, just like regular
tuples. Once you store data in top-level attribute on a namedtuple,
you can‚Äôt modify it by updating the attribute. All attributes on a
namedtuple object follow the ‚Äúwrite once, read many‚Äù principle.
Each object stored in them can be accessed through a unique (human-readable)
identifier. This frees you from having to remember integer indexes,
or resorting to workarounds like defining integer constants as
mnemonics for your indexes.
